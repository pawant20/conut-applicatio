# Conut Application
A platform where user can order and subscribe for coconut water

## Motive
When I started learning Javascript, I created simple mini projects like consuming public RestApi's, creating RestApi's, CRUD operation and etc. When I looked back at all those projects things were looking scattered and incomplete, So I decided to pick one project which can be practical in real world scenario and utilise my learnings at Full potential. 

## Purpose
Consider a scenario where a product(I have picked coconut water) needs to deliver everyday.
There are two approaches to place this kind of order 
1) Create new order every day 
2) Subscribe for the order once and product will be delivered until subscription is expired

This project focus on the second approach where user need to place new order every day

## Basic Application Flow

1)  User creates subscription order
2)  Admin user will confirm the Order and assign to specific delivery partner
3)  From next day onwards delivery partner will deliver the product each day until subscription is expired and for each day he will mark order as delivered
4)  User can track datewise delivery with the help of calendar
