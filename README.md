### A platform where user can order and subscribe for coconut water

##### When I started learning Javascript, I created simple mini projects like consuming public RestApi's, creating RestApi's, CRUD operation and etc. When I looked back at all those projects things were looking scattered and incomplete, So I decided to pick one project close enough to real world scenario and utilise my learnings.
